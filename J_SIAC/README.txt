Running a script: type from terminal
	julia script.jl

** I actually run Julia on Atom. It is a very nice editor (also for python) and you can use its console. I can show you next time. Julia compiles everything the first time you open a terminal. So if you run on a new session all the time, you might find run times rather slow. If you keep a julia session open (like with atom) it only compiles modified files so it is much faster


TODO:
1) Install all the required packages: run

	julia load_packages.jl

2) Test the convolution and plot kernels: run

	julia test_code.jl

3) Test the 2k+1 supercon: run

	julia l2_projection.jl



Let me know if you succeed :)
